# German map symbols
This repository contains a set of universal symbols, especially for maps of the German-speaking area. For adjustments, you can use the [Mapbox maki editor](https://labs.mapbox.com/maki-icons/editor/). It was created as part of a bachelor thesis at the Institute of Cartography, the Technical University of Dresden, in 2021. It includes the most typical symbols from tourist maps. Each symbol is available as a 15px by 15px SVG file. In addition, there is also a version of each symbol adjustable with QGIS. The set is open source, and CC0 licensed.

## Contributing
Feel free to work and add more icons! We are happy to provide more symbols. Please use for a new symbol the ```template.svg```. Inkscape is the best choice for editing. Make sure to use only 15 x 15 drawing area and only paths. You can convert any other type of SVG geometry type into paths.
