# German map symbols
This repository contains a set of adaptable symbols specially for maps of the German-speaking area. For adjustments you can use the [Mapbox maki editor](https://labs.mapbox.com/maki-icons/editor/). It was created as part of a bachelor thesis at the Institute of Cartography, Technical University of Dresden in 2021. It includes the most typical symbols from tourist maps. Each symbol is available as a 15px by 15px SVG file. In addition there is also a version of each symbol adjustable with QGIS. The set is open source and CC0 licensed.
